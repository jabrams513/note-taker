THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
